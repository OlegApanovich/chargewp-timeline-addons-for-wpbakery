Power your WPBakery Page Builder with well crafted timeline addons.

== Description ==
This WordPress plugin introduces well-crafted and fully customizable timeline addons for the [WPBakery Page Builder plugin](https://wpbakery.com). All addons support both the front-end and back-end WPBakery editors.

If you need to organize and present information in chronological order, making it easier for your users to understand the content on your web page, this plugin offers many addons to help with that.

The WPBakery Page Builder plugin must be installed and activated to use this plugin. Once the required plugins are activated, the elements will be available for use in any WPBakery editor.

Source file code you can find on [our GitHub plugin page](https://github.com/OlegApanovich/chargewp-timeline-addons-for-wpbakery). Everyone is welcome to contribute to the development there.
